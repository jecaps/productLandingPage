          Dripping with legends of beasts and witches, the dense, dark, forested
          hills of the Black Forest are endlessly beguiling. Walks in the Black
          Forest place you in the magical heart of this picturesque, fairy-tale
          region, where trails criss-cross a sublime expanse of high hills,
          atmospheric lakes and gorgeous woodland. Traditional medieval towns
          and villages act as charming bases for your adventures. Wake up to the
          sound of the cuckoo clock in an archetypal half-timbered guesthouse
          and stride out onto ancient paths under the brooding, evergreen
          canopy. Magnificent all year round, in the summer you’ll be glad of
          the shade, whilst in winter you’ll be lured onwards by the bewitching
          white wonderland. Discover deep, overgrown gorges; majestic, tumbling
          waterfalls and astonishing views of the Rhine Valley and the distant
          Alps. Hikes in the Black Forest take you to truly enchanting,
          unforgettable places. It’s a hikers’ fantasy land and you’d be cuckoo
          to miss it.
